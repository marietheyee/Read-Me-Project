  Keeping Up With The Folks


  Keeping Up With The Folks is an app for users who are responsible for the health and welfare of their elderly parent(s). It helps users keep track of
  anything related to their parent's healthcare such as current prescriptions, doctor's appointments, lab tests/results, and what health conditions
  their parent has (diabetes, cancer, asthma, allergies, etc.). 
  
  I built this project because I have an 89-year old mother who lives alone at home (her choice). While she's still able to live independently, there have
  been times when I was unable to answer questions on her behalf in a medical emergency. After the last one, I made sure I had a list of her medications,
  the number and location of her pharmacy, and her doctor's contact information. The problem that this solves is not wasting time contacting the doctor
  and pharmacy in a medical emergency - it's a time saver. Plus, it also keeps the next-of-kin informed of their current health status. I learned that in
  medical emergencies, we can't afford to waste time. If the information is handy, the child will be able to answer the emergency room staff's questions.


  INSTALLATION

  To install, first open the file named "Read Me Project" in Terminal. Then type "npm init -y" to activate Node. On the next line, type "npm i inquirer"
  and the questions should pop it.
  

  USAGE

  Once you're in the file, a few questions will appear asking for yours and your parent's information. Please answer them as accurately as possible;
  of course, if things change, edits are certainly allowed.
